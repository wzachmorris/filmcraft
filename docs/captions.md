# Captions

FilmCraft keeps captions on **caption tracks** in the sequence, shown in their own area above the
video tracks (as Premiere does). Caption tracks are saved in the `.fcproj` (project format
version 2; version 1 projects open with no caption tracks).

## Model

- **Caption track** (`CaptionTrack`, `crates/project/src/caption.rs`): name, format (`Subtitle`,
  `CEA-608`, `CEA-708`, `Teletext`), language, output eye (shown in the Program monitor and
  burned in on export), lock, sync lock, and a **track style**:
  font size (pixels at 1080 lines, scaled to the frame), text colour, background box and its colour,
  outline width and colour, alignment (left/centre/right), position (top/middle/bottom) and
  margin (a fraction of the frame height, default 0.08; `captions.setStyle` clamps it to 0–0.45),
  line spacing, and **word highlighting**: with `highlight` on, the word being spoken is drawn in
  `highlight_color` (default yellow), optionally over a `highlight_box_color` box (`highlight_box`),
  word by word as the playhead moves, in the Program monitor and burned in on export.
- **Caption**: in/out in exact `Tick`s, text (lines separated by `\n`; `<i>`, `<b>`, `<u>` kept
  as written), optional speaker, and the WebVTT cue id and cue settings, kept for round trips.
  Captions on a track never overlap.

## Files

| Format | Import | Export | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| SubRip `.srt` | ✓ | ✓ | Forgiving reader (BOM, UTF-16, Windows-1252, CRLF, missing indexes, `,`/`.` ms, missing hours). |
| WebVTT `.vtt` | ✓ | ✓ | Keeps cue ids, cue settings, `<v Speaker>`, STYLE/REGION/NOTE blocks. `line:N%` and `align:` are honoured when drawing. |
| Scenarist SCC `.scc` | ✓ | ✓ | CEA-608 at 29.97 fps. Reads pop-on, roll-up and paint-on; writes pop-on with drop-frame (default) or non-drop timecode. |

`File ▸ Import` (or dropping a file) recognises caption files by extension and content and adds a
new caption track to the open sequence (a sequence is created when none is open). Cue times are
snapped to the sequence's frames. `File ▸ Export ▸ Captions…` writes the chosen caption track in
the format given by the file extension (`.srt`, `.vtt`, `.scc`).

Details of each format and the SCC encoder are in [`crates/captions/README.md`](../crates/captions/README.md).

## Editing

| Command | Menu / shortcut | Params |
|---|---|---|
| `captions.newTrack` | Sequence ▸ Captions ▸ Add New Caption Track… (⌥⌘A) | `format`, `name`, `language` |
| `captions.add` | Sequence ▸ Captions ▸ Add Caption at Playhead (⌥⌘C) | `track`, `text`, `time`, `durationSeconds` (3) |
| `captions.next` / `captions.previous` | Sequence ▸ Captions ▸ Go to Next/Previous Caption Segment (⌥⌘↓/↑) | |
| `captions.showAll` / `captions.hideAll` | Sequence ▸ Captions | |
| `captions.split` | Text panel ✂ | `caption`, `time` (default: every caption under the playhead) |
| `captions.merge` | Text panel | `captions` (consecutive, one track) |
| `captions.setText` | Text panel text field | `caption`, `text`, `speaker` |
| `captions.setTimes` | Text panel in/out fields | `caption`, `start…`/`end…` (`Time` ticks, `Frame`, `Seconds`, `Timecode`) |
| `captions.trim` | drag a caption edge in the timeline | `caption`, `edge` (`in`/`out`), `delta` or `deltaFrames` |
| `captions.move` | drag a caption in the timeline | `captions`, `delta` or `deltaFrames` |
| `captions.delete` | Edit ▸ Clear / Ripple Delete with captions selected | `captions`, `ripple` |
| `captions.select`, `captions.goTo` | click / number button | `captions`, `add` / `caption` |
| `captions.setTrack` | caption track header (eye, lock) | `track`, `name`, `format`, `language`, `enabled`, `locked`, `syncLock` |
| `captions.setStyle` | Text panel style strip | `track`, `font`, `size`, `color`, `background`, `backgroundColor`, `outline`, `outlineColor`, `align`, `anchor`, `margin`, `lineSpacing`, `highlight`, `highlightColor`, `highlightBox`, `highlightBoxColor`, `reset` |
| `captions.deleteTrack` | | `track` |
| `captions.import` / `captions.export` | File ▸ Export ▸ Captions… | `path`, `format`, `track`, `dropFrame` |
| `captions.list` | (query) | `track` — tracks, styles and captions with timecodes (a `track` that names no caption track is an error) |

Tracks are addressed by id or `"C1"`, `"C2"`… (top first). Edits are limited by neighbouring
captions and a one-frame minimum. Sync-locked caption tracks follow insert and extract edits on
the media tracks (a caption across an insert point is split). `Add Edit to All Tracks` (⇧⌘K)
also splits captions. The Track Select tools (A / ⇧A, `timeline.trackSelect`) select captions
along with clips, so dragging that selection moves both together (`timeline.move` with
`captions`) and Delete removes both: a caption the moved block lands on is cut back or removed,
as a clip is in an overwrite.

## Timeline and Text panel

- Caption rows: header with `C1…` badge, lock, output eye, name and format; caption blocks in
  violet showing their text. Click selects (⌘/⇧ adds), drag moves, edge drag trims, double-click
  opens the Text panel. Automation ids: `timeline.caption.<id>`,
  `timeline.captionTrack.C1[.locked|.enabled]`.
- **Word times** (`Caption::words`, schema v16): captions made from a transcript
  (`transcript.createCaptions`) carry each word's time, which drives the highlighting. Editing the
  text keeps the times when the word count is unchanged, else spreads the new words evenly; split,
  merge, move, trim and ripple edits carry the words along. Imported captions have no word times and
  are spread evenly over each caption when highlighted, so the effect works on any track, roughly.
  Caption exports (SRT, WebVTT, …) ignore the times.
- **Text panel ▸ Captions**: search, track picker (also creates tracks of each format), add /
  split / merge / delete / export buttons, the list of segments with editable in/out timecodes
  and text (committed when the field loses focus), and the track style strip (size, colour, box, word highlight,
  alignment, position). Automation ids: `text.tab.Captions`, `text.captions.add|split|merge|delete|export|search|track`,
  `text.captions.<id>.in|out|text|goto|row`, `text.captions.style.*`.

## Burn-in

The Program monitor shows the visible caption tracks. On export, `file.exportMedia`
`{"burnCaptions": true}` (Export mode: **Burn Captions Into Video**) draws them into every frame.
Captions are set in Inter SemiBold (OFL, bundled) by the text engine (`crates/text`: shaping,
kerning, bidi); italics/bold markup is not yet drawn differently. The captions of a nested sequence
are part of the nest's picture: they are drawn wherever the nest is shown, in the Program monitor
and in every export, whether or not the outer sequence shows or burns in its own.
